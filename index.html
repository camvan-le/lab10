    <h1>SEO Techniques</h1>
    <p>From my perspective, one of the most effective SEO techniques is a descriptive page title. A title tag, 
        is an HTML element that gives search engines and web browsers a title for the web page. In this way, 
        title tags significantly affect the webpage’s exposure, especially as it is considered as an unpaid visibility 
        way to grab user’s attention and encourage users to click through to your website. Furthermore, page titles 
        specify how a browser should display the page title in tabs. When visitors have several tabs open, this navigates 
        them to the appropriate website. To maximize its efficiency, a page title should be unique and include the major 
        and target keywords related to the page's content. It is also highly recommended that the length of a page title 
        ranges from 50 to 60 characters to ensure visibility in search engine results without getting truncated. 
    </p>

    <p>Moreover, images and multimedia have a significant impact on SEO. High-quality visuals can increase the website's 
        probability of appearing in search results. When compared to crowded text containing pages, those included with 
        graphics, videos, etc. perform relatively enhanced user experience and engagement more effectively. To optimize 
        the SEO technique, ensure to select the right formats (JPEG, PNG, MP4, etc.). Another suggestion is adding alt text 
        to each image or video. This is because search engine bots cannot analyze pictures and multimedia files; instead, 
        they use the alternative text to comprehend what the images or videos depict and improve the ranking in search results.
    </p>

    <p>Content of value, despite its importance in SEO strategies, is frequently underrated. Websites offering high-quality, 
        relevant, and well-organized content tend to be prioritized and suggested to users in research results. Valuable content 
        should be well-structured, with clean headers, subheadings, and other formatted information. Not only that, those content 
        should be developed based on the specific needs and preferences of the target audience. This increases the effectiveness of 
        users’ interaction, and may result in the increase in traffic and conversion on websites. 
    </p>

    <h1>SMO Techniques</h1>
    <p>When it comes to SMO technique, adding social sharing buttons is a strategy that can yield significant benefits. It is a very simple, 
        yet effective strategy you can use to extend the visibility of your content further. Facebook share button, for instance, acts as a 
        call-to-action button. They make it easy for users to easily share content directly on their personal sites or to others. This tactic 
        may thus result in a significant increase in organic traffic to your website. The more popular your content will be, the greater brand 
        exposure and awareness your sites have within a crowded online space. 
    </p>

    <p>Another technique that I am impressed with is leveraging the content visual appeal and engagement features. Businesses in sectors where 
        graphics are crucial, such as fashion, cuisine, travel, and design, will find this strategy very useful. Take Instagram for example, 
        known as an effective platform for visual storytelling, offering multiple content formats from photos, videos, to interactive features 
        such as reels, stories, and live streams. It helps websites to promote its visibility and build meaningful interactions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, embedding social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook can create  an immersive and interactive experience 
        for your visitors. It enhances your website to be more interactive and updates the users in real time. For instance, as a clothes business, 
        you can easily highlight your latest product photos, feedback from customers, etc by integrating the account into your website. This not only 
        showcases your brand’s personality but also giving potential customers insight of the type of service or product to expect from your business.
